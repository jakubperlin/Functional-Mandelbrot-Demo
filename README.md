## Usage:

+ Install the ML interpreter PolyML from http://www.polyml.org/download.html.
+ Run the interpreter from the folder containing "compute.ml"
+ Type in: *use "compute.ml";*
+ Call the function compute, e.g. *compute (1920, 1080) (−0.74364990,0.13188204,0.00073801) 100;*.
  + The .ppm named "mandelbrot.ppm" should now have been generated. 
+ View it using specialized software or convert to a different format online.
